Note: you'll need OCaml 3.10.x to compile `patterns'.

Typing `make' in this directory should build object files traverse.cmo
and patterns.cmo, which form a framework for writing extensions to
pattern-matching using Camlp4.  Typing `make' in the applications
directory then builds a number of extensions which use the framework
to extend OCaml pattern matching.

For example, once you've built the framework and the applications, you
can use the pa_lazy extension in applications/lazy to extend OCaml
with "lazy patterns" (i.e. pattern matching against lazy values).  If
you have a source file "source.ml" which uses lazy patterns then you
can compile it as follows:

   ocamlc -pp 'camlp4of traverse.cmo patterns.cmo pa_lazy.cmo' source.ml

or, to see the output,

   camlp4of traverse.cmo patterns.cmo pa_lazy.cmo source.ml

If you'd like to check that everything is working, you can run 

   make test

in the applications directory.

Documentation for using `patterns' is available at 

   http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-patterns/

Comments are very welcome.
