0.4

Changes from 0.3

  * Patterns is now packaged as a library that makes it easy to extend
    pattern matching.  Lazy patterns are still available, but as an
    application of the library rather than as a hard-coded extension.

  * Pattern guards are gone for now.  The intention is to restore them
    in a future release, as an optional package implemented as an
    application of the library rather than a hardcoded extension.

  * Patterns should now coexist more happily with other extensions.

  * Lots of examples, e.g. an implementation of conjunctive patterns.
    See the `applications' directory.

  * Everything now works with both original and revised.

  * A number of bug fixes and a more robust, completely functional,
    implementation.

  * The MIT License is included in the source tarball.  (This is just
    a packaging change, not a change of license.)

Changes from 0.1:

  * A new design for pattern guards which allows with-bindings within
    top-level or-patterns (see the documentation)

  * Fewer warnings in generated code: patterns that cannot fail now
    generate `let'-bindings rather than `match'-bindings.

  * More efficient code generated in many cases: for example no
    reference cell is generated when there are no conditional
    patterns in the `with' guards.

  * Documentation (see http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-patterns/wiki/PatternGuards)
